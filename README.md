# CoPrUS_data

This is the CoPrUS MultiWOZ dataset from the publication "CoPrUS: Consistency Preserving Utterance Synthesis towards more realistic benchmark dialogues" accepted at COLING 2025 (main).

Within ``data.zip`` you can find the CoPrUS-modified MultiWOZ dataset in the format of [Convlab-3](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3).

``error_types.json`` lists all modified dialogues with the type of added miscommunication and the turn index at which it was inserted. The repair always is the turn after the miscommunication.
